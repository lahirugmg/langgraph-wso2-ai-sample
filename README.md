# langgraph-wso2-ai-sample

Minimal workspace with a single LangGraph example placed under `agent/`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or newer
- `pip install langgraph`

## Run the sample
1. Change into this directory.
2. Execute `python agent/simple_langgraph.py`.
3. You should see the counter output for each graph step until it reaches three.

Feel free to modify the state or the transition logic inside `agent/simple_langgraph.py` to experiment with LangGraph flows.
